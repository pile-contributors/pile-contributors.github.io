The helpers are a place for support code that
includes the tests. This is an important part of any
pile that clearly shows your pile in action.

We will rely on [googletest][googletest] framework
and this post is designed both to get you started
and to describe the way we are going to test 
the piles. It is provided under 
[New BSD License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).

Preparing
=========

First we need to get [googletest][googletest]. I tried the
repository under Windows with MinGw but it failed to build. Maybe
you are more lucky:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/googletest
cd ~/googletest
svn checkout http://googletest.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ src
{% endhighlight %}

You are on Windows and you don't 
have svn installed, [don't you](http://downloadsvn.codeplex.com/)?!</small>
</small>

So I've got [1.7.0 zip](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/detail?name=gtest-1.7.0.zip).

Building in Windows
-------------------

I'm lazy so I opened the CMakeLists.txt in QtCreator,
configured to `../build` and build. Worked flawlessly.



Building in Ubuntu
------------------

Haven't tried, yet, but this should do it:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/googletest/build
cd ~/googletest/build
cmake ../src
make
# sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

Using it
--------

The `CMakeLists.txt` file does not provide an install terget so I went
ahead and created `~/googletest/install` and copied 
the include directory inside (and removed the internal dir).
I also created `~/googletest/install/lib` and copied 
`libgtest.a` and `libgtest_main.a` inside.

For [CMake][cmake] to see these we will have to add
`~/googletest/install` to 
[CMAKE_MODULE_PATH](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.html).
