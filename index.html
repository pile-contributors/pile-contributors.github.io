    This site hosts resources related to piles.

  <h1 class="section_title">What is a pile?</h1>
  <p>
    A pile is a small piece of code, large and important enough
	for you to remember but smaller than a library
	(but flexibility is added to create static or shared libraries).
	</br>
    The pile is expected to be used in various ways and should 
	be flexible enough to allow several use modes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each such pile consists of two repositories:
	</br>
	- one that only contains the source code, copyright information,
	usage information, called <b>pile</b>;
	</br>
	- one that contains everything else like test code, tools 
	used to generate the source, etc. called <b>pile-helpers</b>.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
  <h1 class="section_title">What tools do I need?</h1>
  <p>
    The tools to be used are CMake and git. The parameters that change
	the functionality are to be passed on using CMake, with
	the source being kept unchanged. Any change to the source should
	be passed upstream to improve the overall quality and usability.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
  <h1 class="section_title">Repositories</h1>
  <p>
    To differentiate actual piles from support repositories, following naming
	convention is to be followed:
	<ul class="unstyled">
	<li><b>pile-xxx</b> is a support repository</li>
	<li><b>yyy</b> is a pile repository</li>
	<li><b>yyy_helpers</b> contains additional code related to pile yyy</li>
	<li><b>pile-template-zzz</b> is template</li>
	</p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Piles use CMake as a build system. Several CMake scripts are provided
    in <a href="https://github.com/pile-contributors/pile-cmake">pile-cmake repository</a>
    to make the job of the developer as simple as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of examples are provided in 
	<a href="https://github.com/pile-contributors/pile-examples">pile-examples repository</a>.
	The only template right now is a C++ template in
	<a href="https://github.com/pile-contributors/pile-template-cpp">pile-template-cpp</a>
	A Qt-based GUI tool is also available in 
	<a href="https://github.com/pile-contributors/pile-gui">pile-gui</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This website source is also hosted in a GitHub repository at 
	<a href="https://github.com/pile-contributors/pile-contributors.github.io">pile-contributors.github.io</a>.
